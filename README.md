Monogame Windows Samples
========================

# About

This repository holds ports I've made of projects at [CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples](https://github.com/CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples) removing non-windows code as well as upgrading projects to VS2012. While an excellent source of code sample, many of the projects available simply wouldn't load for me using VS2012. This repo aims to provide the simplest way for Windows and VS2012 to run the code samples.

I've also made a few style changes and minor optimizations to the code (ie. readonly and const used where possible, epsilons used for floating point operations). Since these are mostly done at the same time as removing code specific to other platforms, it's unlikely they can easily be pushed back to [CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples](https://github.com/CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples).

# Usage

Beginners should do the following:

* Install Visual Studio 2012 (Free through Dreamspark for students)
* Install the latest version of Monogame, available [here](http://www.monogame.net/downloads)
* Install the OpenAL cross-platform audio API for sound available [here](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip) (Otherwise you'll get a DLLNotFound exception when you try to run the sample).
* Clone this repo. If you're new to Github, you should download the client and hit the "Clone in Windows" button at the top of the page.

Hopefully, you can now open and run the samples. If you need any help feel free to contact me at [My-Github-Username]@gmail.com.
